# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on selected features from the Kaggle dataset: *House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques*.

## Features Used
- `GrLivArea`: Above ground living area square footage
- `BedroomAbvGr`: Number of bedrooms above ground
- `FullBath`: Number of full bathrooms
- `SalePrice`: Target variable (house sale price)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle].
2. Place `train.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open `House_Price_Prediction_Linear_Regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score
